A prosthesis is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part. The prosthesis in question is intended to replace a missing hand. I and along with my 3 team members designed the forefinger-thumb portion of the full-right hand prosthesis. An approximation of the range of motion for both the forefinger-tip and thumb-tip and the intersection represents the point-of-contact.
